A massively parallel coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian low Mach number reacting flow 
code is developed and used to study the structure and dynamics of a forced
planar buoyant jet flame in two dimensions.  The numerical construction uses a
finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement for solving the scalar
conservation equations, and the vortex method for the momentum equations, with
the necessary coupling terms.  The numerical model construction is presented,
along with computational issues regarding the parallel implementation.  An
experimental acoustically forced planar jet burner apparatus is also developed
and used to study the velocity and scalar fields in this flow, and to provide
useful data for validation of the computed jet.  Burner design and laser
diagnostic details are discussed, along with the measured laboratory jet flame
dynamics.  The computed reacting jet flow is also presented, with focus on
both large-scale outer buoyant structures and the lifted flame stabilization
dynamics.  A triple flame structure is observed at the flame base in the
computer flow, as is theoretically expected, but was not observable with
present diagnostic techniques in the laboratory flame.  Computed and
experimental results are compared, along with implications for model
improvements.
