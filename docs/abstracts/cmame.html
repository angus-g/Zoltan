In many important computational mechanics applications, the computation
adapts dynamically during the simulation.  Examples include adaptive
mesh refinement, particle simulations and transient dynamics calculations.
When running these kinds of simulations on a parallel computer, the work
must be assigned to processors in a dynamic fashion to keep the computational
load balanced.  A number of approaches have been proposed for this dynamic
load balancing problem.  This paper reviews the major classes of algorithms,
and discusses their relative merits on problems from computational mechanics.
Shortcomings in the state-of-the-art are identified and suggestions are
made for future research directions.
