An adaptive technique for a partial differential system automatically 
adjusts a computational mesh or varies the order of a numerical procedure with
a goal of obtaining a solution satisfying prescribed accuracy criteria in an
optimal fashion.  Processor load imbalances will, therefore, be introduced at
adaptive enrichment steps during the coarse of a parallel computation.  We
develop and describe three procedures for retaining and restoring load balance
that have low unit cost and are appropriate for use in an adaptive solution
environment. <br>

Tiling balances load by using local optimality criteria within overlapping
processor neighborhoods.  Elemental data are migrated between processors
within the same neighborhoods to restore balance.  Tiling is restricted to
uniform two-dimensional meshes and provides limited control of communications
volume by priority-based element selection criteria.  These shortcomings can
potentially be overcome by creating a dynamic partition graph connecting
processors and their neighboring regions.   After coloring the edges of the
graph, elemental data are iteratively transferred between processors by
pairwise exchange to permit a more global migration. <br>

Octree decomposition of a spatial domain is a successful three-dimensional
mesh generation strategy.  The octree structure facilitates a rapid load
balancing procedure by performing tree traversals that (i) appraise subtree
costs and (ii) partition spatial regions accordingly.<br>

Computational results are reported for two- and three-dimensional problems
using nCUBE/2 hypercube, MasPar MP-2, and Thinking Machines CM-5 computers.
