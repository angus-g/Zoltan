As the need for complex parallel simulation software grows, better strategies
for efficient and effective software development become important.
We advocate a toolkit ---  or ``tinkertoy'' --- approach to parallel
application development.
By providing efficient implementations of basic services commonly needed by
applications, toolkits allow application developers to benefit from others'
research, compare algorithms, and save time for their own development.
Unlike large frameworks, toolkits provide these services
with light-weight interfaces and little or no restriction on application data
structures, making them easy to use in both new and existing applications.
In this paper, we describe features of effective toolkit design, using the
Zoltan parallel, dynamic data management toolkit as an example.
