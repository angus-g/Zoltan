Massively multithreaded parallel architectures such as Cray's MTA and XMT are
proving to be highly effective for graph analysis algorithms.  By providing
uniform memory access times for data with much irregularity and little
locality, these machines have demonstrated excellent scalability for a wide
range of graph-based algorithms.  However, no apples-to-apples comparisons
between these architectures and our traditional distributed memory
architectures had been performed using realistic input data.  In the PageRank
Derby, we implemented Google's web-page ranking system using both distributed
memory and massively multithreaded paradigms, and compared performance on the
Cray MTA and XMT with distributed-memory Linux clusters and RedStorm.   In
this talk, I will describe the PageRank algorithm and its implementation on
both massively multithreaded and distributed memory architectures.  And I will
present the results of the PageRank Derby.
