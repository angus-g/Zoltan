We describe a fine-grained, element-based data migration system that
dynamically maintains global load balance on massively parallel MIMD
computers, and is effective in the presence of changing work loads. Global
load balance is achieved by overlapping neighborhoods of processors, where
each neighborhood performs local load balancing. The method supports a large
class of finite element and finite difference based applications and provides
an automatic element management system to which applications are easily
integrated. We test the system's effectiveness with an adaptive order (-)
refinement Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the solution of
hyperbolic conservation laws on a 1024-processor nCUBE2. The results show the
significant reduction in execution time synergistically obtained by combining
the automatic data migration system and the adaptive finite element method.
