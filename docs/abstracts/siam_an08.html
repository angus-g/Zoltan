Software development in scientific research environments poses many
significant and conflicting challenges. Research environments (and their
associated drive to publish! publish! publish!) require rapid and flexible
software development that simplifies experimentation with new algorithms and
data structures. Simultaneously, for our work to impact a broader community,
we must create nearly production-quality software, as well as provide user
support and code maintenance. With these conflicting demands (and, often,
shrinking budgets), the right balance between research and software
development is difficult to define. This talk will discuss these issues and
suggest software design solutions that can ease the burden of software
development in a research environment. Examples will be drawn from the
Zoltan and Trilinos toolkits, as well as Sandia's new PDE Rapid Development
effort and the SciDAC ITAPS (Interoperable Technologies for Advanced
Petascale Simulations) project.
