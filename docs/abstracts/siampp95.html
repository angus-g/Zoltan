We describe a dynamic load-balancing strategy for parallel finite element
methods with adaptive mesh (h-) and order (p-) refinement. The load-balancing
algorithm is based on the tiling load-balancing system, where global balance
is achieved by performing local balancing within overlapping neighborhoods of
processors. Tiling is applied to each mesh level created by the adaptive
h-refinement. Weights are used in the migration routines to reflect the
nonuniform elemental work loads caused by adaptive p-refinement. The
combination of adaptive refinement and tiling significantly reduces total
execution time relative to fixed-mesh, fixed-order methods yielding comparable
accuracy, as we demonstrate with experiments on an nCUBE/2.
