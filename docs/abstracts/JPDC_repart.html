In parallel adaptive applications, the computational structure of the
applications 
changes over time, leading to load imbalances even though the initial load
distribu- 
tions were balanced. To restore balance and to keep communication volume low
in 
further iterations of the applications, dynamic load balancing
(repartitioning) of the 
changed computational structure is required. Repartitioning differs from
static load 
balancing (partitioning) due to the additional requirement of minimizing
migration 
cost to move data from an existing partition to a new partition. In this
paper, we 
present a novel repartitioning hypergraph model for dynamic load balancing
that 
accounts for both communication volume in the application and migration cost 
to move data, in order to minimize the overall cost. Use of a
hypergraph-based 
model allows us to accurately model communication costs rather than
approximat- 
ing them with graph-based models. We show that the new model can be realized 
using hypergraph partitioning with fixed vertices and describe our parallel
multi- 
level implementation within the Zoltan load-balancing toolkit. To the best
of our 
knowledge, this is the first implementation for dynamic load balancing based
on 
hypergraph partitioning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
we con- 
ducted experiments on a Linux cluster with 1024 processors. The results show
that, 
in terms of reducing total cost, our new model compares favorably to the
graph- 
based dynamic load balancing approaches, and multilevel approaches improve
the 
repartitioning quality significantly.
