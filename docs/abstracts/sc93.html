We construct massively parallel adaptive finite element methods for the
solution of hyperbolic conservation laws. Spatial discretization is performed
by a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method using a basis of piecewise
Legendre polynomials. Temporal discretization utilizes a Runge-Kutta method.
Dissipative fluxes and projection limiting prevent oscillations near solution
discontinuities. The resulting method is of high order and may be parallelized
efficiently on MIMD computers. We demonstrate parallel efficiency through
computations on a 1024-processor nCUBE/2 hypercube. We present results using
adaptive -refinement to reduce the computational cost of the method, and
tiling, a dynamic, element-based data migration system that maintains global
load balance of the adaptive method by overlapping neighborhoods of processors
that each perform local balancing.
