The Particle Strength Exchange (PSE) scheme is useful for modeling diffusion
of vorticity in a purely Lagrangian numerical construction.  This is done in a
fully-coupled non-split implementation of diffusion and convection.
Unfortunately, there is no similarly general Lagrangian scheme for modeling
the arbitrary circulation source terms, such as those due to baroclinic
vorticity generation in a reacting flow environment.  We present and analyze
both non-split and split hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian formulations that allow
the modeling of baroclinic vorticity generation.  We find that the non-split
implementation, even though fully coupled, does not achieve second-order time
accuracy in the context of a second-order Runge-Kutta construction.  On the
other hand, the symmetric operator-split formulation does achieve
second-order convergence, and is clearly superior in this context.  This
formulation is being presently used in the context of hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian computations of reacting flow.
