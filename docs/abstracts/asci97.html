Load balancing is a crucial part of parallel simulations.
Within Sandia's ASCI program, many different load-balancing
algorithms and tools enable successful parallel computation.
The Chaco static partitioning package is used
as a pre-processor to applications to provide initial
decompositions.  This tool is coupled with the Nemesis
parallel mesh database to enable efficient input and output on
parallel computers.  Dynamic load balancing is used in particle
methods, contact detection algorithms, and adaptive finite element
methods.  In this talk, the load-balancing tools and methods
used in Sandia's ASCI program are discussed.
