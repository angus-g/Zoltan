Adaptive numerical methods offer greater efficiency than traditional numerical 
methods by concentrating computational effort in regions of the problem domain 
where the solution is difficult to obtain. In this paper, we describe progress 
toward adding mesh refinement to MPSalsa, a computer program developed at 
Sandia National Laboratories to solve coupled three-dimensional fluid flow and 
detailed reaction chemistry systems for modeling chemically reacting flow on 
large-scale parallel computers. Data structures that support refinement and 
dynamic load-balancing are discussed. Results using uniform refinement with 
mesh sequencing to improve convergence to steady-state solutions are also 
presented.
