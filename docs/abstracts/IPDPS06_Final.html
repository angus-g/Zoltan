Graph partitioning is often used for load balancing in parallel computing,
but it is known that hypergraph partitioning has several advantages.
First, hypergraphs more accurately model communication volume, and second,
they are more expressive and can better represent nonsymmetric problems.
Hypergraph partitioning is particularly suited to parallel sparse
matrix-vector multiplication, a common kernel in scientific computing.
We present a parallel software package for hypergraph (and sparse matrix)
partitioning developed at Sandia National Labs. The algorithm is a variation
on multilevel partitioning.  Our parallel implementation
is novel in that it uses a two-dimensional data distribution among processors.
We present empirical results that show our parallel implementation
achieves good speedup on several large problems (up to 33 million nonzeros)
with up to 64 processors on a Linux cluster.
